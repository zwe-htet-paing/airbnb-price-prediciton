# Experiment Tracking

This folder contains notebooks and scripts for tracking experiments in the Airbnb Price Prediction MLOps project, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Notebooks

* `airbnb-prices-prediction-EDA.ipynb`:
Covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including data cleaning and feature engineering.

* `airbnb-prices-prediction.ipynb`:
Baseline model testing for initial training and evaluation.

* `airbnb-prices-prediction-mlflow.ipynb`:
Uses MLflow to track preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Experiment Tracking with MLflow

Tracked components include:

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Baseline and advanced model performance
* Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics
